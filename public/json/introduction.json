  "description": "Welcome to the TechLaunch Curriculm Web. This project's purpose is to help students be able to query all the resources that they have gained (depending on which classes they have completed or currently in) based on a particular topic. For example, if a student is having trouble understanding asynchronisity and applying it using javascript, they will be able to query all the resources (videos, presentations, assignments, tests, projects, etc.) that are on the particular subject dating back when they first started the program. This will also help us see how many assignments are dedicated to particular topics and allow us to add resources to the curriculm or bonus resources we can share with the students and provide them when they need them."
